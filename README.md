* About
  * Jo Egner, software engineer, hotel art vs mona lisa if I can make it not sound terrible
  * Site uses Gatsby so GraphQL & React
  * Hobbies - coding, baking, video games, knit & crochet
* Practical
  * Better description for WeInfuse
  * Update skills based on WeInfuse
  * Needs some serious style - don't go all the way to the edge, color, spacing
  * Refactor - not to much copy + paste w/ Typography. Keep styling in mind
* Theoretical
  * side nav
    * big screen
      * doesn't overlap with screen content
    * small screen
      * minimized w/ just icons showing by default
      * Temporary drawer - darkens background when opened
  * Landing page - NFRs? Accordian of most bare bones philosophies?
